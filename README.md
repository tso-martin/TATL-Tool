# TATL-Tool
This tool provides a MATLAB implementation of the IEEE 738-2012 standard for simulating the thermal behavior of overhead line conductors listed in IEC EN 50182-2001. It is capable of calculating
- PATL (permanently admissible transmission loading)
- TATL (temporary admissible transmission loading) for a given time frame
- Time to overheating of conductors for a given current
- Adiabatic short-circuit heating
- Transient conductor temperature curves

The source code is a contribution to the conference paper:
